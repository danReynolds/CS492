# Positions of each team:

## Team A:

Internet = no need for students to go to class.

Online platform = flexibility, access.

Online learning helps people with disabilities using software like TTS or audio transcripts etc, services that aren't available in traditional classrooms.

Less intimidated, can ask a question without judgement.

My other points: bad profs vs 1 good prof records online once and goes for years as the content.

## Team B:

Teachers can track student's performance and learning process better?
Can get distracted when learning online.
Get to communicate with professors in realtime.
Courses that require oral communication schools like CS492 does not work online.
Teachers can improvise, speed up or slow down lecture as needed.
Decreases collaboration, there is online chat and google docs but not the same.
Can stop to ask questions.
